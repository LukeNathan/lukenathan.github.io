    The efficiency of solar panels depends on how well they measure the amount of sunlight that's converted into actual electricity. <br />A solar panel system should be able to convert 15-20% percent of the sunlight that hits it into electrical power.<br/> The most efficient solar panels on the market, from brands such as Sunpower and Panasonic convert around 21% of the energy <br />in sunlight to power.
    <br /><br />
    What is the efficiency of wind power?
    Wind turbines can convert nearly half of the wind hitting them into electrical power. The efficiency is measured by the actual amount of kinetic energy that's converted. The ultimate conversion rate is estimated to be about 60 percent. <br />If a turbine could absorb 100 percent of the wind's energy, the blades of the turbine would automatically stop turning.
    <br /><br />
    There are further limitations when converting wind into energy because of the way electrical generators are designed and manufactured. <br /> The average power conversion rate currently peaks at about 45 percent, but the maximum peak performance might be able to reach 50 percent
    <br /><br />
    The one benefit of wind over solar for your home is that wind turbines can generate power 24 hours a day <br />since they aren't dependent on sunlight. Wind is considered more efficient than solar because these systems use less energy,<br /> release less carbon dioxide, and produce more overall energy. A single wind turbine can generate the same amount<br /> of electricity in kWh or kilowatt-hours) as thousands of solar panels.
    <br /><br />
    But the energy produced by wind turbines doesn't make it better. The turbines take up space,<br /> can't be used in highly populated areas, and can take a terrible toll on the birds. These systems require nearly<br /> sky-scraping positioning that are a great distance from trees and taller buildings.
    <br /><br />
    Where does solar power work best?
    <br /> <br />
    The sun is everywhere, although some places are naturally sunnier than others. So, geography can influence the efficiency<br /> of solar panel conversion, as well as the panel's direction. Clouda are the worst enemy of solar panels, which is why<br /> it's not widely used in the southeast. Sunny places such as deserts are the best locations for solar panels.
    <br /><br />
    Where does wind power work best?
    <br /><br />
    Wind isn't always as available in certain places as sunlight. When considering using wind turbines, geography matters more.<br /> Turbines require environments that are almost barren of large structures and buildings, such as open fields.<br /> Additionally, some areas restrict the construction of any type of structure beyond a certain height.
    <br /><br />
    The biggest issue for solar panels is the fact that they can only be used at night. Wind turbines however also have issues,<br /> such as noise pollution, constant specialized maintenance, and its obvious size.
