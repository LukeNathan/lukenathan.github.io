    <p class="head"> Goal 13: Climate Action </p>
    <p class="g11">Most climate scientists agree the main cause of global warming is the human expansion of the greenhouse effect; <br/> warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.
    <br /><br />
    Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere <br />and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as "forcing" climate change. Gases, <br />such as water vapor, which respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are seen as "feedbacks."
    <br /> <br />
    Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:
    <br /><br />
    Water vapor. It is the most abundant greenhouse gas, and acts as a feedback to the climate. Water vapor increases<br /> as the Earth's atmosphere warms, but so does the possibility of clouds and precipitation, making it one <br />of the most important feedback mechanisms to the greenhouse effect.
    <br /><br />
    Carbon dioxide. A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released <br />naturally through mechanisms such as respiration and volcano eruptions, and through human activities such as deforestation, <br />land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by more than <br />a third since the Industrial Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived "forcing" of climate change.
    <br /><br />
    Methane. A hydrocarbon gas produced both through natural sources and human activities, including the decomposition<br /> of wastes in landfills, agriculture, and especially rice cultivation, as well as ruminant digestion and manure <br />management associated with domestic livestock. Methane is a far more active greenhouse gas than<br /> carbon dioxide, but is also much less abundant in the atmosphere.
    <br /><br />
    Nitrous oxide. A powerful greenhouse gas produced by soil cultivation practices, especially the use of commercial and<br /> organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid production, and biomass burning.
    <br /><br />
    Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Synthetic compounds entirely originated in industrial applications, but now<br /> largely regulated in production and release to the atmosphere due to their ability to contribute to<br /> destruction of the ozone layer. They are also greenhouse gases.
    <br /><br />
    According to the IPCC, the effects of climate change on individual regions will vary over time and with the ability of <br />different environmental systems to mitigate or adapt to change. The IPCC predicts that increases in global average temperature of less<br /> than 1 to 3 degrees Celsius above 1990 levels will produce beneficial impacts in some regions and harmful ones in others.
