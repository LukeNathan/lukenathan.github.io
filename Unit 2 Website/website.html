    <p class="g7">
    The efficiency of solar panels depends on how well they measure the amount of sunlight that's converted into actual electricity. <br />A solar panel system should be able to convert 15-20% percent of the sunlight that hits it into electrical power.<br/> The most efficient solar panels on the market, from brands such as Sunpower and Panasonic convert around 21% of the energy <br />in sunlight to power.
    <br /><br />
    What is the efficiency of wind power?
    Wind turbines can convert nearly half of the wind hitting them into electrical power. The efficiency is measured by the actual amount of kinetic energy that's converted. The ultimate conversion rate is estimated to be about 60 percent. <br />If a turbine could absorb 100 percent of the wind's energy, the blades of the turbine would automatically stop turning.
    <br /><br />
    There are further limitations when converting wind into energy because of the way electrical generators are designed and manufactured. <br /> The average power conversion rate currently peaks at about 45 percent, but the maximum peak performance might be able to reach 50 percent
    <br /><br />
    The one benefit of wind over solar for your home is that wind turbines can generate power 24 hours a day <br />since they aren't dependent on sunlight. Wind is considered more efficient than solar because these systems use less energy,<br /> release less carbon dioxide, and produce more overall energy. A single wind turbine can generate the same amount<br /> of electricity in kWh or kilowatt-hours) as thousands of solar panels.

    <p class="g11">Most climate scientists agree the main cause of global warming is the human expansion of the greenhouse effect; <br/> warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.
    <br /><br />
    Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere <br />and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as "forcing" climate change. Gases, <br />such as water vapor, which respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are seen as "feedbacks."
    <br /> <br />
    Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:
    <br /><br />
    Water vapor. It is the most abundant greenhouse gas, and acts as a feedback to the climate. Water vapor increases<br /> as the Earth's atmosphere warms, but so does the possibility of clouds and precipitation, making it one <br />of the most important feedback mechanisms to the greenhouse effect.
    <br /><br />
    Carbon dioxide. A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released <br />naturally through mechanisms such as respiration and volcano eruptions, and through human activities such as deforestation, <br />land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by more than <br />a third since the Industrial Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived "forcing" of climate change.
